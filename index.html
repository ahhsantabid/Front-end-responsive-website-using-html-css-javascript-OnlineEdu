        <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">Coding, in the simplest of terms, is telling a computer what you want it to do, which involves typing in step-by-step commands for the computer to follow.

            Computers are not clever things, however they are very obedient. They will do exactly what you want them to do, so long as you tell them how to do it correctly.
            
            Learning to code has been likened to learning a foreign language, or perhaps more specifically a family of foreign languages.
            
            There are many different coding languages, each one designed with certain things in mind. Examples include C, a ‘low level’ but fast programming language that is good for anything graphically intensive like games; Javascript, which was specifically designed for dealing with web content; and Perl, a multi-functional language that is often referred to as the ‘swiss army knife’ of programming.</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">Sport is among the most beneficial influences on humankind. While sport may illuminate some of man’s less admirable traits, it concurrently brings out man’s commendable qualities and it is these praiseworthy qualities that should be noted rather than man’s innate imperfections. ssion and community. These positive virtues are  a united front they are imparted onto others, penetrating the monotony and strife that inhibits the world. King David Linksfield was witness to this in 2011 upon the first team rugby boys winning the rugby finals. While the victory was exhilarating, it was the love, brotherhood, pride and joy generated by this triumph that reverberated through the school for days to follow. It was the win that unified the school and was testimony to sport’s capacity to bring out the best in people.

        We can never forget the 96 victims of the Hillsborough Disaster in 1989, nor may we be oblivious to the countless incidents where fans have resorted to aggression.</p>
